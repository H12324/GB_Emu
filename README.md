### SM83 Opcode Progress    (497/500)
- [X] 8-bit Loads           (85/85)              
- [X] 16-bit loads          (15/15)         
- [X] 8-bit Arithmetic      (92/92)

#### Overall Plan
- [ ] Implement Opcodes
- [ ] Make timing accurate
- [ ] PPU + Graphics
- [ ] Input
- [ ] Audio??
- [ ] Mappers?
- [ ] Expand to Colour????

? = Likeliness to not implement
