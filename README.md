Why finish a project when you can just start a new one!


### SM83 Opcode Progress    (221/500)
- [X] 8-bit Loads           (85/85)              
- [X] 16-bit loads          (15/15)         
- [X] 8-bit Arithmetic      (92/92)

- [ ] Input
- [ ] Audio??
- [ ] Mappers?
- [ ] Expand to Colour????

? = Likeliness to not implement
